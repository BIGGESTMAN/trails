ok fuck all this shit:
	cp rewards:
!		display reward conditions for encounter under path progress once they're discovered (otherwise show the relevant number of "unique cp condition: ?"s)
		add particle indicating when enemies can be damaged for cp
	encounter rewards:
		flawless/swift victory bonuses
		change 'mechanics rating' to '% of possible cp obtained'
	gorilla boss
		add passive cleave
		fix fists of fury not ending on kill
		add uninterruptable startup time/warning to fists of fury
	general encounter bugfixing/mechanics:
		give both teams vision of arenas while encounters are active
		make enemies spawn randomly in back half of arena instead of all in clump in middle
!		do something about units being knocked outside of arena (move them back inside every 0.1 seconds or something i guess)
		implement aggro (attacks whoever's dealt most damage in last 5 seconds, damage counts for less aggro if dealt from greater range)
	implement gameflow past first three paths
	kill master quartz/linking for now
	show crafts unlocked in fight result window (top-left thing with gold & cp & stuff) and show glow around ability icon that fades after ~8 seconds
!	show progress along current path while on a path in top-right window
	add healing numbers a la damage numbers
	remove damage numbers/cp reward particles for when damage/cp amount is 0
	update hero select screen (add info on which crafts start unlocked/are unlocked later)
	update infotext popup
	add path difficulty scaling for bosses
	add difficulty scaling based on number of players
	force everyone to be on radiant
!	add 'counter-hit' state to enemies for a short time after every autoattack, enabling cp gain if attacked by a hero?

	paths:
***		heroes start with 1 craft (q) + s-craft unlocked
***		3 normal paths + 1 final path
***		each normal path unlocks a random craft for each hero, which can be seen when picking which path to do
***		each path consists of two groups of normal enemies (groups shared between paths) and then one unique boss
		can shop & stuff in between paths
??		mana & cp is only reset in between paths

	rewards/cp:
***		performing certain actions, varying by enemy, rewards cp
***		dealing any damage by itself/standing around no longer gives cp
***		interrupting an enemy craft/channel always rewards cp
***		last hits also give cp
***		completing encounters (normal enemy groups) gives some amount of cp to all party members

	other stuff/ideas to add:
***		steal enemy spellcast announcements from bossrush (make them show up above enemies, not at top of screen)
		replace autoattacks with 6th no-cost craft, kill attackspeed; add a 5th path and start with no crafts except no-cost and s-craft?
		add craft upgrades based on use/'cheevos' (s-break a lot, upgrade wild rage to wild rage 2, etc)
		add 'monster guide' players can reference

	visual goodies:
		add fancy fe-esque skill callout in corner of screen; maybe use when master quartz effects are triggered too?
		red flash when encounter starts
		scrolling/popping(at end of animation) totals of cp/gold rewarded from fight
		enemies drop from sky at start of encounter
		make cp bar flash or glow or something when cp is gained

	ai:
		make shrooms/gordis a bit smarter about trying to target spores/go ape
		make enemies try to ignore sleeping targets?
		fix enemies 'sliding' around as they move to where their target was
		unify how knuckleduster/fists of fury move-to-target-to-cast logic works

	make regular enemies scale with path number too? (harder to dodge abilities or w/e)
	figure out what to do with master quartz and/or linking



	ideas:
		brave abilities:
			burst link abilities, replacing 4th regular crafts?
			make s-crafts only function by burst link mechanic?
			make master quartz active be burst link ability?

			every unbalance, get a brave point
			on unbalance, if total brave points are maxed (10), s-crafts become active temporarily
			if any s-craft is used, brave points are used up, but same amount is spent for 1 s-craft used or multiple
			s-crafts are powerful effects + cause a unique 'powered-up' state afterward for a duration
				rean: movement or movement effects cause next autoattack to deal bonus % hp damage (a la wind god's fan)
				estelle: all damage instances echo themselves after a short delay, for reduced damage; damage instances grant flat healing
				alisa: autoattacks turn into skillshot arrows which grant cp to all allies hit and increase in damage for each ally hit
			200 cp s-crafts are the same ability, but their powered-up states are permanent until the end of the fight

		rewards for paths past first set of crafts unlocked: unlock 'true' ability runes, which can be fully unlocked by cheevos and are goofy d3-esque ability variants

		add a 'sepith' resource which governs master quartz progression?
			sepith generated differently for each quartz (maybe by triggering their abilities?)
			sepith is rewarded for paths once all crafts are unlocked?

playtest 5/14 results:
**	add tear
**	add some way to regain ep
**	fullheal + ep on wipes?
**	need way more cp
**	add resource management later -- for now, start all fights at full hp/ep + 100 cp?
**	why are quartz stats broken so hard lol
	fists of fury doesn't end on kill
	add uninterruptable warning/startup time to fists of fury
**	fists of fury is bugged and does 3000 damage, oops
	add 'monster guide'?
