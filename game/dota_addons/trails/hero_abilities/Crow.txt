[Q] Rapid Volley (rapid_volley) : Crow delivers suppressive fire, randomly dealing physical damage around an enemy for 3 seconds. Crow can move while shooting, but is interrupted on taking damage from a craft or art or when the target is too far away. The rate of fire increases over time.
Enhanced : Increases base rate of fire and maximum range. Each hit knocks enemies back and inflicts delay for 0.2 seconds.
DevNotes - Fires 1 shot at the start, then in 0.25 second intervals, reduced by 0.05 each second. The enhanced version starts at 0.2 second intervals. The area radius is divided into four 90° segments. The first shot damages within the north-east segment of the circle. The next occurs in the north-west segment, proceeding counterclockwise.

[W] Freezing Bullet (freezing_bullet) : Crow fires a shot that leaves a trail of frost in its path. After 1 second, the trail coalesces into a wall of ice that blocks movement. The wall can be shattered by any damaging craft or art from an ally, dealing magical damage to enemies on the other side. The trail and wall Freezes each enemy the first time they approach it.
Enhanced : The wall forms immediately and deals magical damage to enemies when Freezing them. The shatter damage is also increased.
DevNotes - The cast range is trail/wall length. The trail becomes a wall after the shot completes traveling, which means the real delay is 1.4 seconds. Each trail/wall only Freezes each enemy once and ends previous instances of Freeze, dealing its pure damage. The damage is dealt in a 500 x 800 box, on the opposite side of the hero that shattered the wall. The wall just melts if it reaches max duration.

[E] Wild Card (wild_card) : Crow draws a card to aid or hinder a random hero. If it's an ally, it increases their STR or DEF and ADF or gives them CP Boost. If it's an enemy, they are Confused or suffer a Deathblow.

[D] Chaos Trigger (chaos_trigger) : Crow takes aim with a bullet of pure insanity, locking on to enemies within a line. He fires a piercing shot at the first enemy he locks on to, dealing physical damage to enemies hit. The first enemy hit is Nightmared, and any other enemies hit are Confused. Crow can turn at a reduced rate while aiming, but is interrupted on taking damage from a craft or art.
Enhanced : The aiming period is tripled. Crow continues to aim after firing, but the additional shots don't apply Nightmare or Confuse.
DevNotes - The shot is instant, hitting the locked-on enemy and any others standing on the line Crow and the target form.

[R] Cross Raven (cross_raven) : S-Craft: Crow unleashes bullets in all directions, which home into an area after a delay and detonate to deal physical damage. Enemies away from the center take decreased damage. Can be cast again up to 2 times to alter their destination, their travel speed increasing over time.
200 CP Bonus : Deals more damage. All enemies hit are put into a Nightmare, and enemies that take maximum damage suffer a Deathblow.
DevNotes - On cast, he fires bullets away from him over 1 second, each with adjusted travel speed so they're all 1000 radius away from him at 1.5 seconds. Earlier bullets can pause at 1000 radius to achieve this. The travel speed and travel speed increase below is applied once they begin their return. The final/slowest bullet is the 'real' one, be loose with the others for visual fanciness but that one can be reliably used to time the damage on reaching their destination etc.
